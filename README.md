# ClimateWins - Machine Learning

## üåç Project Overview

**ClimateWins** is a machine learning initiative aimed at understanding and forecasting the impacts of climate change‚Äîstarting with Europe and potentially expanding globally. The project explores historical weather data, including hurricane data from NOAA (U.S.), typhoon records from the JMA (Japan), and a wide range of European weather metrics. The primary focus is to assess the potential of machine learning algorithms to classify and predict extreme weather events, which have notably increased in frequency over the last two decades.

By leveraging weather data spanning over a century, this project aims to build predictive models that can anticipate climate patterns and help plan for future scenarios more effectively.

## ‚ùì Research Questions

This project explores several key questions:

- How can machine learning techniques be applied to historical weather data?
- Are there specific ethical considerations when using AI/ML in climate prediction?
- What are the historical extremes (highs and lows) in temperature across Europe?
- Can we build models to predict daily weather favorability and identify potentially dangerous conditions?

## üìä Dataset

The project utilizes long-term climate data collected from **18 weather stations across Europe**. The dataset includes daily records from the late 1800s up to 2022 and covers variables such as:

- Temperature  
- Wind speed  
- Snowfall  
- Global radiation  
- And more...

The dataset is sourced from the **European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D)** project, recognized for its high-quality historical climate data.
